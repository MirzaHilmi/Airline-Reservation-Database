# Airline Reservation Database
`Final Project for the Database System Course`

This repository contains the final project for the [Database System Course](https://github.com/MirzaHilmi/Database-System-Course). The project is developed as part of the course requirements and aims to showcase the knowledge and skills gained during the course.

## Project Description

The project is a database system designed for a fictitious airline that sells airline tickets for multiple flight schedules. The system allows users to browse and purchase airline tickets for specific dates and times. Once a ticket is booked, users will be prompted to complete the payment process. Additionally, the system allows the Database Admin to view all procedures and records that are stored every time a customer books a ticket.

## Early Design of the Database

The database schema is designed with the following entities:

- `Flights`: stores information about each flight, such as flight number, destination, departure time, arrival time, and capacity.
- `Customer`: stores information about each customer, such as username, email, and phone number.
- `Ticket`: stores information about each booking, such as booking ID, customer ID, flight ID, and booking date.
- ... 
 
The schema is designed to ensure data integrity, prevent data redundancy, and allow for efficient data retrieval.
